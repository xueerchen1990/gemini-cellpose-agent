# Jupyter Notebook Demo

## Overview

I created a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of a cellpose agent powered by the Gemini API. The notebook is hosted on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/xueerchen/xueer-s-cellpose-agent-powered-by-gemini-1-5-flash).

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to:

1. **Register on Kaggle**: If you don't have a Kaggle account, you can sign up [here](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. **Provide Your Gemini API Key**: You need to add your Gemini API key as a Kaggle secret.
